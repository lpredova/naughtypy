# naughtypy

naughtypy is a little ugly program drunk written in python that gets a random comment from a random pornhub video. 
Also, I've made a tumblr bot and twitter that posts these comments at:

[https://twitter.com/DailyRandomPorn]()

Don't judge, there are many mind blowing comments that you'll see.

## You need to have BeautifulSoup installed to use it:

	$ pip install bs4
	
and sometimes you'll have to install parser libs

    $ pip install --upgrade lxml
    $ pip install cssselect

## And you run it with: 

	$ python naughtypy.py



## Known bugs:
* sometimes it just crashes
